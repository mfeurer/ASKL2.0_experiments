**This repository is provided as-is and we do not plan to provide maintenance. 
Necessary scripts will be ported to the main Auto-sklearn repository.**

## Code organization

This repository contains experiment scripts for the above mentioned paper submission. We
will clean up the code over time to make it easier to understand and reproduce our results
while keeping its functionality. The code is organized into two directories:

* *experiment_scripts* contains all scripts we used for the experiments. A manual
  describing in which order to execute the scripts is given in HowTo.md.
* *notebooks* contains several jupyter-notebooks which we used to analyze the results
  and produce the tables and plot given in the paper.
